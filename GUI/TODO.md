To Do:

- User spending categories: users can edit a list of them

- Figure out current user and how that will be determined (what gui needs to worry about for it)

- Control panel/generic buttons for each page (maybe use CustomCTkParts.py for common buttons)


Dependencies:

customtkinter
tkcalendar
